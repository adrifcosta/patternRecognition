Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones

The task of this project is to develop classifiers for Human Activity Recognition using data collected from 30 subjects
performing activities of daily living while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial
sensors. Are considered two scenarios:

--> Scenario A (Binary Problem): where one where one want to discriminate if a given person is
walking or not;

-->Scenario B (Multiclass Problem): where differentiation among six different activities are required
(walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and laying).
